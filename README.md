# NeuralCards 🧠

> An AI/ML flashcard app I built to help people (and myself) actually learn machine learning properly.

## What is this?

I was studying AI/ML and realized there's no good flashcard app specifically for it. Anki is great but making cards is painful, and most learning platforms don't have active recall built in. So I built NeuralCards — it has interactive flashcards, structured learning paths, spaced repetition, and even AI-generated content through Groq.

It's a full-stack React app with Supabase on the backend. You can sign in with Google/GitHub, practice flashcards across 50+ topics, follow 7 curated learning paths from math basics to interview prep, and track your progress on a personal dashboard.

## Features

**Flashcards** — Flip-to-reveal cards with smooth animations. The AI can generate new cards on any topic using Groq API (proxied through Edge Functions so the API key stays safe).

**Learning Paths** — I put together 7 paths that cover everything:
1. Math for ML (linear algebra, calculus, stats)
2. Python for AI (numpy, pandas, sklearn)
3. ML Fundamentals (regression, classification, clustering)
4. Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, transformers)
5. Modern AI (GPT, BERT, diffusion models, RL)
6. MLOps & Deployment (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)
7. Interview Prep (system design, coding, case studies)

**Spaced Repetition** — Uses the SM-2 algorithm to schedule cards based on how well you know them. Cards you struggle with show up more often.

**Dashboard** — Track your study streaks, accuracy, cards studied, and path completion.

**Blog** — Articles on AI topics like transformers, neural networks, etc.

**Dark/Light Mode** — Switches with your system preference or manually.

**Auth** — Google and GitHub OAuth through Supabase. Guests can browse around but need to sign in to actually practice or access the dashboard.
