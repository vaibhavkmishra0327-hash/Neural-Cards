                "concept": "A vector is an ordered collection of numbers that represents magnitude and direction in space. In machine learning, vectors are the fundamental data structure used to represent features, weights, and data points. A vector space is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars while following specific mathematical rules.",
                "why": "Vectors are essential in ML because: (1) They represent data - each data point is a vector of features, (2) They enable efficient computation - operations on vectors are optimized in modern hardware, (3) They allow geometric interpretation - helping us visualize and understand ML algorithms, (4) They form the basis for understanding more complex structures like matrices and tensors.",
                "intuition": "Think of a vector like a GPS coordinate with extra dimensions. Just as (latitude, longitude) pinpoints a location on Earth, a vector [height, weight, age] represents a person in 3D 'feature space'. In ML, we often work with hundreds or thousands of dimensions, where each dimension represents a different feature of our data.",
