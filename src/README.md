## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Motion (Framer Motion) for animations
- React Helmet for SEO
- Vite for build

**Backend:**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)
- Hono (web framework on Deno)
- KV Store pattern for flexible schema

**Deployment:**
- Vercel (frontend hosting)
- Supabase (backend + database)
- Cloudflare (CDN, recommended)

### System Flow

```
User → React Frontend → Supabase Auth → Hono API Server → PostgreSQL KV Store
                                     ↓
                              Spaced Repetition
                              Progress Tracking
                              Streak Calculation
```

## 📖 Sample Topic: Backpropagation

**Fully implemented with:**
- ✅ SEO-optimized title and meta description
- ✅ 10 comprehensive flashcards (concept, formula, code)
- ✅ Python code examples
- ✅ Real-world use cases
- ✅ Common pitfalls and solutions
- ✅ 6 FAQs targeting search queries
- ✅ Related topics linking

**Example Flashcard:**

**Front:** What is backpropagation?

**Back:** Backpropagation (backward propagation of errors) is an algorithm for computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights of a neural network. It uses the chain rule to efficiently calculate how each weight contributes to the total error.

**Real-World Example:** When training a neural network to recognize cats, backpropagation calculates how much each neuron's weight needs to change to reduce prediction errors.
